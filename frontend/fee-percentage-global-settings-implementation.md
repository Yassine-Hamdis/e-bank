# Fee Percentage Global Settings Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented fee percentage management in the admin dashboard global settings and disabled fee input fields across the application to ensure centralized fee management.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Updated Global Settings Models
Modified `src/app/models/auth.model.ts`:

export interface GlobalSettings {
  maxClientAccountBalance: number;
  maxDailyNewClients: number;
  feePercentage: number; // NEW
}

export interface UpdateGlobalSettingsRequest {
  maxClientAccountBalance: number;
  maxDailyNewClients: number;
  feePercentage: number; // NEW
}

export interface UpdateFeePercentageRequest {
  value: string;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Settings Service
Added new service method in `src/app/services/settings.service.ts`:
```typescript
updateFeePercentage(feePercentage: UpdateFeePercentageRequest): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.put<any>(`${this.API_URL}/global/feePercentage`, feePercentage);
}
```
